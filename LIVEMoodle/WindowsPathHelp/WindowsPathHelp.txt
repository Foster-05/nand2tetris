Much of what we do in the course will come from the command line. For windows, you will need to add the nand2tetris\tools directory to your path.

You can do this by editing the system environment variables. However, on Bucknell computers, this seems to be overwritten.

I have developed a small script that will set your user path to include the current folder.

To use this:

a) Copy the "AddDirectoryToPath.bat" _into_ the directory with all of the executable files.
b) Double-click the AddDirectoryToPath file. (A command window will briefly flash up)
c) Open up a new terminal (CMD.exe) and the executable files within the directory should now be accessible.

You only need to do this once, and windows should remember. However, Bucknell may periodically wipe these variables (or you may use a different computer). In that case, just repeat the process.
